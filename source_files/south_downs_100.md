# South Downs Ultra

The second of my two 100-hundred-mile runs was to be the UK Ultra's South Downs 100mile Ultra. This race had attracted my attention as I used to live in Worthing, which is sandwiched between the South downs and the coast. Other than the rough location I didn’t really know much about the race, as the vast majority of my preparation had been for the Peak District 100 (the previous weekend).

## Travel

The start for the race was divided into two waves depending on if your thought you would finish in under 24 hours or not. Although I assumed the course would be fast, I felt joining the faster group might be a be ambitious. This meant my start would be at midday on the Saturday, (the faster group starting 4 hours later).

With trains being trains I didn’t really want to risk an early start and travelling down on Saturday, so I opted to travel the day before (and make it more of an adventure). After a leisurely start I caught a train from York to Kings Cross and then strolled across London to Waterloo. After a bit of a delay at Waterloo whilst I performed a secret mission on behalf of my daughters I then caught a train down to Petersfield. The train arrived just after the bus had left, so I spent the hour exploring Petersfield.

Finally got the bus for the 5 miles down the dual carriage to Queen Elisabeth Park and the start of the race / camp site for the night. I must admit to having a slight navigation error when getting off the bus which then resulted in my reaching the park’s office at 5.01pm. (They closed at 5pm). After some hammering on the door I was let in and managed to explain I was booked into the campsite. There seemed to be some confusion as they hadn’t heard from the Event organisers but gave me a key and pointed me in the direction of the campsite.

The campsite is in a large field at the foot of Butser Hill, the second highest hill in the South Downs. Strangely it takes a while to find a good pitch for your tent when you have the entire campsite to yourself. After a quick meal of noodles I decided to test out my legs by walking to the top of Butser Hill. A few minutes later on I was on the top and admiring the view over Havent, the Solent and onto the Isle of Wight in the distance.

As I returned to the campsite, the temperature suddenly dropped so I dived into down sleeping bag (which I had previously questioned bringing) and emersed myself in a book. A few minutes a fellow competitor ‘Billy’ turned up – I was no longer I alone!

## The Race
A combination of it being a new race, covid and two starting waves meant there were only 21 people on the start line. After a short race briefing we were off and entering the woods I found myself at the front with Marcel and Russel. A mile later and Russel and I were deep in conversation about different
canal races we had done and hadn’t noticed a pack of people sneaking up on us. At this point, Marcel zoomed off and I dropped a few places. Just before the hour mark I took my first walking break, which was a good way of cooling down. Once refreshed I caught and overtook the lead group putting me into
second place as I approached the first check point.

Not having a plan(!) I had a minor panic at this point. Did I really want to try hold second position for the next 92 miles for what was going to be a very hot day? As it wasn't due to be at its hottest until a few hours time (at 5pm) I decided that I should push quite hard till then and try to maintain my position if
I could. This seemed to work well and I didn’t really see anyone approaching until I was at the top of the hill after Goodwood checkpoint. At this point it was clear I was going to be caught so the challenge was how long could I hold him off. Upon reaching Amberley I turned along the river Arun towards the city of Arundel. These were the first parts of the route that I could remember from childhood, including the Black Rabbit pub!. A couple of minutes before the Arundel checkpoint, Darren caught me and we complimented each other on an exciting battle.

We left the checkpoint together and it soon began to get dark. I was intending on taking it easy during the night section in order to be refreshed for the following day and he was happy to follow suit so we teamed up. The Findon village checkpoint was soon reached and we were served a hot meal of pasta, veggie sauce and cheese – this went down very well. 

At this point I should mention that although this race is along the South Downs, it doesn’t just follow the South Days way. Instead the route is made up of a combination of the Monach's Way, the South Downs Way and a few extra hills thrown in for additional pain. The Monachs Way is based on the route that
Charles the II took during his escape from Cromwell. This meant the route wasn’t all that direct, and I expect there were a few vocal complaints around the zig-zagging we had to do in order to reach Devils Dyke.

Just before Devil’s Dyke we were intercepted by the race director who was checking we weren’t going to miss the same turning as Marcel had. (I expect we would have done). The race team had done an amazing job of marking the entire 100 miles route, I’ve no idea how many signs and bits of tape there were but
other than a couple of turns navigation was easy.

Reaching the checkpoint we were slightly confused to learn that we were now in first place having passed
Marcel. This puzzle was solved a few seconds later by the man himself turning up and explaining he had
gone wrong 3 times – he didn’t look too happy!

The rest of the night was a combination of power walking and painful attempts at running over the rough
ground. Finally, the sun began to rise and it was time for Darren to meet his support runner at the next
checkpoint. Although I was not in full race mode at this point, I was expecting Darren and his friend to
zoom off so I left the check point at full speed assuming they would soon catch me.


After navigating through a field of cows and their calves and a brief stretch along the Meridian Way I
turned and could no longer see them behind me. At the end of the next long track however I glanced back
and saw two runners approaching at speed. I pushed on towards the next checkpoint at South Ease
expecting to be caught at any moment. I was caught but it wasn’t Darren, but a runner (and his support
runner) from the fast wave. He was the race leader and had gained 4 hours on me. We left together
chatting as we ascended the hill from South Ease. They were much quicker than me and I had no intention
of trying to keep with them, so I was soon on my own again.

The race follows the South Downs Way until Alfriston, at this point the route takes in an extra hill in
order to see the Long Man of Wilmington. It was at the bottom of this hill was I caught by the next runner from
the fast wave.

I had learned that there were only 3 runners remaining in the second wave, so my goal was to finish
fourth and as close to 24 hours as I can manage. Not knowing how close behind me the next runners were,
I decided to push hard for the remaining 20 miles.

After the next checkpoint at Jevington, the end at Eastbourne came into sight, but we soon turned away
from it from a few more small hills. I glanced back and panic – there was a runner approaching me very
fast. As they flew by me I realised they were doing the 20 mile race which had the same finish as me.
Running what I could, I eventually reached the final checkpoint and shortly after that at the coast. Almost
done I thought to myself until a race marshall said, just follow the path up Beachy Head! There were loads
of 20 mile runners passing me at this point, so the new challenge was to try and keep with them by power
walking up the hill.

A final steep downhill (oh my quads!) and a blast along the seafront and the race was complete.
Collapsed at table by the finish line my thoughts turned to getting home – even getting up from the
chair was going to be a challenge. I decided to take advantage of the massage tent which I think I was
very smart move. A combination of a shuttle bus, 2 trains and the underground and I was back in York to
be met by my oldest daughter.

## Conclusion
I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about the race not knowing anything about the race company. As it
turned out the whole event was great. Fantastic route, well stocked checkpoints and a nice relaxed and
friendly attitude.

I entered the race not having any goals other than finishing. Expecting my legs to give up after 10
miles I wouldn’t have been surprised if I had come last. In the end my legs felt tired a couple of miles
sooner than normal, but in a 100 mile race that doesn’t make much difference :-)

Being in the slower wave meant I wasn’t swept along by the fast runners and I could set my own pace. I
also had the psychological advantage of being at the front of my wave. Navigation was easy, and the ground very dry
meaning most of it was runnable.

The big question is…. If I was to do the race again on fresh legs would I be able be able to beat 24
hours….
