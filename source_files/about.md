Hi,  I'm one of the co-founders/treasurer of [YorkDevelopers.org](https://YorkDevelopers.org) and also organise the monthly YorkCodeDojo meetup.

### Skills

I've got over 20 years of experience as a professional software developer.  During that time I've used a number of different programming languages and technologies.  My current area of expertise is on Python, React.js, AWS and Postgres.  Previously I was using the Microsoft Stack (C#, F#, SQL Server, Windows and .net Core).  

I've also got a keen interest in Cyber Security,  and have completed twice in the Masterclass final of the [Cyber Security Challenge](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/).

### Ultra Running

When I'm not coding or with my family then I'm often out running.  I normally run in the excellent series of [Hardmoors](https://www.hardmoors110.org.uk/) ultra races on the North York Moors.

In 2018 I completed the Winter Spine race along the length of the Pennine Way.  This was a fantastic adventure but by far the hardest challenge I've every done.

### Contact me

If you wish to contact me then I'm [@da_betteridge](https://twitter.com/da_betteridge) on Twitter, [dbetteridge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbetteridge/) in Linkedin or come and find me at the [Code-and-Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/yorkdevelopers/) meetup in York each Wednesday morning.
