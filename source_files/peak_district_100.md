# Peak District 100

This really is a race of 2 halves.  The course is based on a figure of eight, with two 50 miles loops.  Starting from Buxton the first loop takes you south on a cycle track towards Bakewell and Matlock, with a couple of hills before returning via another cycle track to Buxton. The second loop takes you north and is much hillier taking in Shining Tor,  Mam Tor and a monster of a  hill just outside of Hope.

## Travel
I travelled down the day before on the Friday by train. With the train strikes this meant it took longer than normal as I had to go via Manchester.  Once in Buxton I then had a two mile up hill walk through the country park to the campsite. The campsite is in a nice location (in an old quarry) but was a bit too busy for me!  After pitching my tent I walked back down in Buxton to pick up some food and then back up the hill ago.  I went to bed early but was kept awake by a some very noisy neighbours.

## Race Day
In a burst of enthusiasm, I was up at 5am and packed up by quarter past.  Back down the hill and ready for the registration which opened at 6am. This gave me plenty of time for breakfast and last minute faffing before we were walked to the start line for the 7 oâ€™clock start. After a short race briefing from Richard, smoke bombs were let off and the race started.

## South Loop
The first 4 miles are pretty straight forward over some fields and down (and up) deep dale. This passed quickly enough as Helen and I were using the opportunity to catch up.  The race then continues down the Monsal cycle track. This is my favorite part of the first half, as the track passes though a steep side limestone gorge and through several long tunnels. The first checkpoint breaks up the track and then we caught up with the tail runners from the Bakewell Parkrun.

After the cycle track we turn left onto Combe Road,  which is a rough track heading up hill through a farm and wood.  At this point Helen shot off on a mission and I decided to hold back. I was concerned about burning out of the hills in the second half and suffering the following week on the South Down ultra.

After Bakewell we followed the Heritage trail alongside a steam railway and river towards Matlock.  This is followed by the only real hill in the south loop. Eventually the top of the hill is reached and we joined the Limestone trail.  The route is a bit messy as we have to pick our way across some fields (avoiding killer cows).  I was running with Nicola at this point who came 2nd female on the 50 mile course.

We were then returned towards Buxton along another cycle track â€“ the Tissington Trail. This is a bit of a never ending nightmare,  which feels like it's up hill for itâ€™s entire length.  Fortunately all the 100 mile runners seemed to be suffering on it. I expect the 50 mile runners were just gritting their teeth and getting on with it as the end was in sight for them.

## North Loop
Returning to the school in Buxton,  I allowed myself a slightly longer pit stop.  This gave me time to change my top,  eat a rice pudding and grab a couple of tea.  In less then 10 minutes I was on my way, having now gained a couple of positions.  The challenge was could I get to the next checkpoint before being caught by the people I had just left behind.  This is one of the nicest sections, starting with a long climb up to Shining Tor.  From there we then followed a ridge line on nice runnable flag stones before dropping down a road/track just above a reservoir.  This was also the site of the next checkpoint â€“ which I had reached before being caught ðŸ˜Š

I was soon off,  heading towards Whaley Bridge.  Just before the town I noticed a sign showing the route turned off the road and to the right into a field.  I felt sure that when I reccied it I just continued along the road. I took the turning anyway and ended up in a field overlooking a building site.  At that point I was caught be a pack of runners.   Jointly we considered our options,  return back to the road,  or climb over the fence into the building site.  In the end,  sense prevailed and backtracked to the road.

The pack of runners soon shot off as we heading through the park towards the canal.  At this point I met with Jake who I then ended up running with for most of the remainder of the race. The canal took us onto New Mills and it's picturest gorge (which was dark at this point).  From there we joined the Sett Valley Trail,  which is another old railway line.  The heat of the previous day was now replaced by several hours of heavy rain and thick mist.  Finally the end of the trail was reached and the check point at Hayfield.   This was some route finding confusion trying to find the checkpoint.  Even now I claim we had correctly followed the signs!  (We were rescued by someone elses support team! )

Our moral wasn't great at the checkpoint.  It was dark and very wet and the next section was going to be quite hilly. After forcing down a toasted cheese sandwich we dragged ourselves back out before we were caught by the next runner. The following few hours were just a slog in the rain until eventually Mam Tor was reached.  Approaching the road before Mam Tor I managed to make the same mistake as I did on my reccie and ended up a several meters off the track away from the gate.  Fortunately this time I knew how to get quickly back to the path.

Mam Tor was quickly passed and following by the other 3 peaks on the ridge-line.  Looking back was could see another head torch gaining on us.   The ridge-line is great in the daylight,  but not so good in thick mist.  From the final hill we then dropped down into Hope and the next checkpoint.  I felt cold, really really tired and hungry at this point.  At this point the race leaves Hope,  does a loop and then returns to the checkpoint.  I took the opportunity to change my soaked t-shirt for a thermal top,  and left it for collection when I returned!

The next runner,  Louise caught us in the checkpoint and the three of us left together.  Climbing out of Hope the other two were having much better time then me.  I was still falling asleep on my feet.  Once we reached the farm yard I told them I was going to sleep for 10 minutes and they should go on.  I think they assumed I was going to drop out and return to the checkpoint.  After a 10 minute cat nap,  I felt much better and decided to push on.  A few minutes later the rain stopped,  it became daylight and Louise's caffeine tablet kicked in - I felt great.

I had been slightly fearing the loop out of Hope,  but actually it's great hill with fantastic views from the top.  After the hill the route winds through some villages and fields (with cows) and then returns you to Hope.  As I approach the checkpoint I see a couple of runners leave and wonder if they are Jake and Louise.

This time there is no messing around at the checkpoint.  I grab my discarded t-shirt, refill my water bottles and I'm off.  The aim was to catch the other two runners,  which I guess had a ten minute lead on me.  From Hope I power-walk down to the next village of Castleton and the start of Cave Dale.  Still feeling recharged after my power nap I speed up the Dale and soon catch up with Jake and Louise - who were a bit surprised as they had been told that I had dropped out.

We then continue on together chatting away, alternating between a fast walking and easy running. Whilst discussing the different races we had ran, Louise and I discovered that we had previously met on the Liverpool to Leeds Canal Race!

We were making good time until we reached the hill along Sitch Road just after Peak Forest.  At this point we were stuck for about 10 minutes whilst we waited for a large herd of cows to be moved for milking.  he three of us felt fairly relaxed about it as the race pack was now so far spaced out it was not going to make any difference to our final position.

After Sitch Road the large quarry is soon reached which has it's own railway line which is crossed by a footbridge.  At this point we found that Louise isn't very keen on heights.  After a few minutes we successfully crossed this, I expect more due to her guts than Jake and mine words of encouragement.

A couple of fields later and the outskirts of Buxton is reached.  After a slow jog through the town center the final hill came into view.  At the top of the hill, Helen and Paul were cheering me on.  I managed a decent sprint up the hill to them and was soon joined by the other two. We turned into the school and crossed the finish line together.

The hall at the finish was fairly empty,  so after a cup of tea and a change of clothes and I staggered back to the train station.  The walk was only about 1km but we quite painful with my bags!


## Conclusion

An enjoyable race, with better weather I would have gone quite a bit faster during the night section.  I've also learnt not to be afraid of stopping for 5-10 minutes naps - the time is soon made up.
