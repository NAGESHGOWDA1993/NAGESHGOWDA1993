I work as a Senior Technical Architect for a startup called [Hivemap.](https://hivemap.io) We use a range of technolgies which include Python, Postgres, AWS, React.js, S3, Elasticsearch and Neptune.

Prior to working at Hivemap, I worked for several years for the Proactis Group producing
e-procurement software. During this time I provided solutions for a range of global companies including universities, large charities, city banks, and housing trusts.

I am a co-founder of the York Developers charity, which arranges technical meetups and events in York.
These include a monthly Code Dojo where attendees pair up and work on a new problem each month.

I have spoken a number of times at community usergroups 
In my free time I'm a keen runner and have competed in several ultra-marathons.  These include the Winter Spine Race,  the Hardmoors 200 and the Arc of Attrition.  More information about my running can be found <a href="/running/">here</a>.
