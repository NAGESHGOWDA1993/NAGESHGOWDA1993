# Running

In my free time I'm a keen runner and have competed in several ultra-marathons. These include the Winter Spine Race,  the Hardmoors 200 and the Arc of Attrition.

Most of my runs can be found on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6352224)

I've been plotting my more interesting (and longer runs) on a [map.](/running/index.html)

During the Summer of 2022 I (accidentally) entered two 100 mile races a week apart. These were the [Peak District 100](/target_files/peak_district_100.html) and [South Downs 100](/target_files/south_downs_100.html)

My most recent adventure was a solo fastpack along [Hadrian's Wall](/target_files/hadrians_wall.html)
