Some notes so that I remember what I did!

## Domain Name
I purchased the domain name from 123-reg

## Cloudflare
Configured a free account on Cloudflare
Using the 123-reg management portal,  changed the nameservers to use the Cloudflare ones

## Git Hub Pages
Set the custom domain name against the DavidBetteridge.github.io repro to be davidbetteridge.net

Using the Cloudflare management portal created 'A' records to point at github

Site became available straight away
