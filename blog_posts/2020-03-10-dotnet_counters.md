## dotnet-counters

.NET Core 3.0 and above has built in support for monitoring performance counters generated by your application.

### Getting started

Install as a global dotnet tool using `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters`

Then view the list of available counters using `dotnet-counters list`.  At the time of writing there are two sets, `System.Runtime` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting` although it is possible to also monitor user defined counters.

``` powershell
System.Runtime
    cpu-usage                                    Amount of time the process has utilized the CPU (ms)
    working-set                                  Amount of working set used by the process (MB)
    gc-heap-size                                 Total heap size reported by the GC (MB)
    gen-0-gc-count                               Number of Gen 0 GCs / sec
    gen-1-gc-count                               Number of Gen 1 GCs / sec
    gen-2-gc-count                               Number of Gen 2 GCs / sec
    time-in-gc                                   % time in GC since the last GC
    gen-0-size                                   Gen 0 Heap Size
    gen-1-size                                   Gen 1 Heap Size
    gen-2-size                                   Gen 2 Heap Size
    loh-size                                     LOH Heap Size
    alloc-rate                                   Allocation Rate
    assembly-count                               Number of Assemblies Loaded
    exception-count                              Number of Exceptions / sec
    threadpool-thread-count                      Number of ThreadPool Threads
    monitor-lock-contention-count                Monitor Lock Contention Count
    threadpool-queue-length                      ThreadPool Work Items Queue Length
    threadpool-completed-items-count             ThreadPool Completed Work Items Count
    active-timer-count                           Active Timers Count

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
    requests-per-second                  Request rate
    total-requests                       Total number of requests
    current-requests                     Current number of requests
    failed-requests                      Failed number of requests
```

Start your application running than find it's PID,  either using `ps`,  TaskManager or easier still `dotnet-counters ps`

``` powershell
    12345   MyApplication c:\software\MyApplication.exe
```

## Real-Time Monitoring

The `dotnet-counters monitor` command can be used to view the counters as they change in real time.  It should be started with `-p` followed by your application's PID and then a space separated list of counters to monitor.   (The documentation says that all counters are included by default, but I found that only the `System.Runtime` ones are.)

This example shows all counters

``` powershell
dotnet-counters monitor -p 12345 System.Runtime Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
```

``` powershell
Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    Status: Running

[System.Runtime]
    # of Assemblies Loaded                           179
    % Time in GC (since last GC)                       0
    Allocation Rate (Bytes / sec)                204,200
    CPU Usage (%)                                      0
    Exceptions / sec                                   0
    GC Heap Size (MB)                                 23
    Gen 0 GC / sec                                     0
    Gen 0 Size (B)                             9,415,056
    Gen 1 GC / sec                                     0
    Gen 1 Size (B)                                   856
    Gen 2 GC / sec                                     0
    Gen 2 Size (B)                             9,156,440
    LOH Size (B)                              10,809,624
    Monitor Lock Contention Count / sec                0
    Number of Active Timers                           10
    ThreadPool Completed Work Items / sec              1
    ThreadPool Queue Length                            0
    ThreadPool Threads Count                           4
    Working Set (MB)                                 147
    ...
```

Individual counters can be monitored by listing them within square brackets.  For example

``` powershell
dotnet-counters monitor -p 28764 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting[requests-per-second,failed-requests]
```

``` powershell
Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    Status: Running

[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting]
    Failed Requests                                    0
    Request / sec                                      0
```

An optional `--refreshInterval` argument controls (in seconds) how often the counters are refreshed.

## Collection

In addition to monitoring the counters in real time it is possible periodically collect them and write them to a file using `dotnet-counters collect`

This takes the same `-p`,  `--refreshInterval` and list of counters as the `monitor` command,  but also takes two additional arguments `--format` and `--output`

+ `--format` is the type of file to create,  either `csv` (default) or `json`.
+ `--output` is an optional argument to specify the name of the file to create.  By default this is `counter.csv` / `counter.json` and will be created in the current folder.

It looks like this file will get pretty big quickly,  so choose the counters to collect and refresh interval wisely!

## Troubleshooting

If no counters are being collected then

1. Using `dotnet-counters ps` double check the PID of your process.

2. Make sure that the list of counter sets is correct.  These are space separated (not comma separated).  e.g `System.Runtime Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting` not `System.Runtime, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting`

3. If you are specifying individual counters,  then make sure that these are commas separated without any spaces. e.g  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting[requests-per-second,failed-requests]` not `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting[requests-per-second, failed-requests]`
