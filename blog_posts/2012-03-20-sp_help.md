TITLE: Improving sp_help
END_META

## Note - This is now built it to later versions of __SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)__

[sp_help_table_schemas.sql]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/sp_help_table_schemas.sql)

One of the nice things about __SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)__ is that you can highlight a table name in a script and press __Alt + F1__ to perform sp_help on it.

Unfortunately I've never been able to use that feature as the majority of the tables in our product belong to a schema other than __dbo__.

On a long train journey back to York I wondered if I could solve this problem by writing my own replacement for __sp_help__ (which I’ve called __sp_help_table_schemas__).  

My version works by first checking the system tables to find out which schemas the table belongs to

```sql
SELECT s.Name   --Find the schema
 FROM sys.schemas s
 JOIN sys.tables t on t.schema_id = s.schema_id
 WHERE t.name = 'Orders'
 ```

 It then dynamically calls the standard __sp_help__ method but this time supplying the table owner as well.

```sql
 SET @cmd = 'EXEC sp_help ''' + QUOTENAME(@SchemaName) + '.' + QUOTENAME(@ObjectName) + ''' ;' ;           
EXEC ( @cmd )
```

Once I had proved the basics worked I wrapped it up into a stored procedure and deployed it to the master database on my laptop.  It was then just a question of going into __Tools -> Options__ within __SSMS__ and defining the keyboard short cut

A couple of notes 
*   You can’t amend the existing __Alt+F1__ entry so I went with __Ctrl+F1__ for my replacement.  
*   You need to open a new query window for the change to be picked up

So I can now highlight a table name and press __Ctrl+F1__

The completed script is [sp_help_table_schemas.sql]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/sp_help_table_schemas.sql)

Thanks go to Martin Bell who reviewed my stored procedure and give some valuable advice.
